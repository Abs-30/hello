        Life is not every bodies turf. Different human beings have different perspectives on life.
         some have life just for living. Some to achieve and some to be disasters for others. But finally all these s*** humans die. Which is an absolute truth of the life.
        They way humans of the life can be classified is shown below.
        <ul>
          <li>Just living</li>
          <li>achievers</li>
          <li>Disasters</li>
        </ul>
        Although every sh** humans has the same fate they differ only in their own motives. Which makes living life harder to the rest
